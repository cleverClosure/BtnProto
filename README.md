# BtnProto

BtnProto is a little logic game where your goal is to press all the buttons on the grid. The hard part is that different buttons behave differently. For example: when you press standard (blue) button, every adjacent button will be pressed too. And a button with a lock picture on it can't be pressed directly. 


The game is still under construction
